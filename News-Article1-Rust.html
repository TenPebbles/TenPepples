                    Rust is a rusty coding language full of rust, rust, and rust. In reality, it is a cool low end coding language similer to c++. However, there are some differences between the two.

                <div class="home-content-title"> Rust vs. C++ </div>
                <div class="home-content-text">
                    the main difference between Rust and C++ is that Rust has a lot more safety measures embeded in it, especially when it comes to memory safety. This is an advantage from C++ as C++ ditches many possible memory safety measures in favor of effitiancy and speed. 
                    However, don't let this make you think that Rust is less effitient than C++. If executed properly, Rust can be just as fast and effitient and C++. (Albeit some code fine tuning and object rendering tools and efficiency are lost. ) However, there are some areas in which C++ is superior to Rust. Because C++ has existed for a much longer time,
                    there is a lot more infastructure for C++ than Rust. For example, there isn't a well know widespread game coding platform (like Unity for C++) for Rust. It's library and ecosystem is genrally less expansive and detailed than other, older languages. It has fewer frameworks and is supported less commonly. However,
                    as Rust evolves, we could see it emerge as the new golden standard for tasks that require more memory safety, or the language of choice for those who don't want to deal with creating and manageing their own barebones memory system. Overall, both of them have their advantages and senarios in which they shine and no one language is better than the other. I hope you found this interesting and informative. stay coding until next time!
