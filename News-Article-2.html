                    C is a low end coding language that is the basis for many other coding languages. In fact, it is so low end that it is the oldest and first coding language to exist other than binary. Due to this, pretty much every other coding language is build off of C or build off of something that was build of of C. (C++, Rust, and many other low end languages are build off of C.)               </div>

                    The reason that C is used so frequently in emmbeded systems, computer architectures, operating systems, and more is due to its sheer effitiency. Because it is the simplest coding language and closest to binary in its nature, it takes the least amount of time and effort for C out of any other coding language to talk to the computer and for the computer to understand and execute the commands that
                    it is given. The other main reason it is so time and energy effitient is since it is so simple and has almost no pre written and defined functions, the computer only has to spend time rendering and processing the things that you have actually written and use in the code, as there is nothing extra slowing it down or making it less energy effitient.
                    However, this is also C's greatest weakness. Because it is so basic, anything process that you want to run has to be pre- defined, making it incredibly un-efficient to type and create, as you have to spend a lot of your time creating the systems and functions that might already be coded in when using a higher end language. However, it makes sense that people would opt for C regardless of this, Because
                    if you focus is on quality, speed, and energy/ data efficiency it is well worth the process to code in C. I hope you found this article interesting and informitive and that you give learning C a chance, especially if you want to go into game development as C++ (an extention of C) is the most frequently used language in that field for good reason. Stay Coding!
